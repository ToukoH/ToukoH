### About me
I'm a math student with a great interest towards software and data science. During my leisure time I like to play the guitar and engage in various musical activities.

Currently I'm working on:
- **Finishing my studies**
- **Some side projects, including a trading platform and a tool which allows you to run Python and C within the same file.**
